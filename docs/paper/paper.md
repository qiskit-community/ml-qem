# Summary

ML-QEM is an open-source machine learning library designed to address 
the challenges of solving quantum computing problems. By integrating 
cutting-edge machine learning techniques with the intricacies of quantum 
computing, ML-QEM provides a comprehensive set of tools for researchers 
and practitioners in the field. This library enables the application of 
classical machine learning algorithms to quantum computing, bridging 
the gap between the two domains and accelerating the development of 
quantum applications.

# Statement of need

The field of quantum computing presents an array of complex challenges, 
ranging from efficient unitary synthesis to error mitigation and correction. 
These challenges require innovative approaches to unlock the full 
potential of quantum computers. Recent advances in machine learning 
(ML) have showcased their ability to tackle some of the toughest problems 
across various domains. Recognizing this potential, there is a pressing 
need to leverage classical ML techniques in the field of quantum computing.
